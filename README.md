# About Me

I'm a 28 years old software engineer based in Helsinki, Finland. I'm originally from Iran and have been living and working in Finland since 2015. I'm the co-creator of [Buttercup](https://buttercup.pw) and co-founder of MadDev, a company that my friend and colleague ([Perry](https://perrymitchell.net) and I have founded together as a result of creating Buttercup. I'm also the Lead Engineer in [Tieto](https://www.tieto.com/) as my day job.

This repo is meant to give you an idea about my work and career as a programmer, and more importantly, a place to remind myself of things that matter to me.

This document is a Work in Progress. I doubt that it will be an interest to anyone but myself, but if you're curious, you can watch the repo for changes.

## Programming Languages

* **JavaScript** (and it's family) is my main programming language and I use it at work and for my own projects too. I especially like the typed variations of JavaScript (namely Typescript and Flow) and I use NodeJS for systems programming and embedded systems too.
* **Rust**. I have been learning and experimenting with Rust for a while. I'll be using it for systems/server programming.
* **Swift**. I learned Swift a while back to make my own native iOS app. I've been using it here and there for solving some problems.
* **PHP**. Before the Javascript revolution (2009+), I was a full-time php developer for many years. Github wasn't popular (and didn't exist) back then so I don't have much to show for it except the infamous (and now deprecated) [JDateTime](https://github.com/sallar/jDateTime).

And many more languages that I had to learn and experiment with during my years as a programmer. Notably **Java**, **QBasic**, **Visual Basic** and **C#**. I'm open to learning new tools and languages and I appreciate good code in any language. But for the time being, my languages of choice will remain JS and Rust.
